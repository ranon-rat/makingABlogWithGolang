# How to use this blog 


First you need to clone the blog,
after that you need to encrypt your ipv6 to sha256 and
copy and replace the text with your ip in the file [adminip.txt](https://github.com/ranon-rat/makingABlogWithGolang/blob/main/src/adminip.txt)
then of that you need to push it in any cloud service like heroku where I have it hosted. 

![heroku](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/820472030474272769/826275292040396800/Captura_de_Pantalla_2021-03-29_a_las_20.02.45.png)
Now you only need to make your first publication to the  route `admin/postfile` push the title , the url image and the body in markdown obviously
